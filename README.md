# SpectraBot - Color Sorting Robot
SpectraBot – Intelligent Color-Sorting Robot using ESP32  SpectraBot is an IoT-enabled autonomous color-sorting robot built using an ESP32, TCS3200 color sensor, dual servo motors, RGB indicators, and a web-based dashboard powered by AsyncWebServer. The system detects the color of incoming objects, sorts them into predefined bins, and streams real-time sensor data to a responsive web interface.  Key Features:  Accurate color detection using the TCS3200 sensor  Automated sorting mechanism driven by two servo motors  Web dashboard for calibration, live monitoring, and settings control  Built-in voice feedback (TTS API) and buzzer alerts with independent toggles  Wi-Fi–based control and data visualization (HTTP/REST or WebSocket compatible)  Fully customizable, modular, and extendable codebase  This project demonstrates embedded systems, robotics, IoT communication, and UI engineering using HTML/CSS/JS.
